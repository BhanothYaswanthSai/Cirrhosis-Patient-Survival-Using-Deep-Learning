# Cirrhosis-Patient-Survival-Using-Deep-Learning
This project predicts the Cirrhosis Patient Survial.
“Worldwide population faces the Cirrhosis as it endorses irreversible damage to the liver. Correct prognosis is one of the key factors in proper treatment plans and a good recovery. The survival probability of cirrhosis patients is successfully predicted in this study using deep learning methods.

The construction of a deep learning model will require a complete dataset including patient information, clinical features and laboratory data. This method is about the development of entirely new paradigm that will be capable of recognizing/comprehending complex patterns in data and be able to provide reliable forecasts of the survival. The model uses an evolved neural network on which features are being extracted and it learns representations that capture the complex details of the process of liver cirrhosis.

The research is expanding knowledge about a new and prospective domain of Medical AI. Through this, the prospects of deep learning technology playing a ground-breaking role in establishing the outcomes for patients with cirrhosis are being demonstrated.

Subsequently, this finding might have more implications for personalized medicine allowing to create more specific and effective treatments and achieve better outcomes for liver patients.”
